# sola-raylib

sola-raylib is an actively maintained Rust bindings and wrapper for
[raylib](http://www.raylib.com/) 6.0. It currently targets Rust toolchain
version 1.78 or higher.

- View the docs: https://docs.rs/sola-raylib/latest/sola_raylib/

**Versioning:** sola-raylib's major version tracks raylib's major version — 5.x
binds raylib 5.5, 6.x binds raylib 6.0, and so on. Minor and patch numbers are
sola-raylib's own (raylib doesn't follow strict semver, so this project doesn't
try to mirror it beyond the major).

This project is a fork of
[github.com/raylib-rs/raylib-rs](https://github.com/raylib-rs/raylib-rs) from
commit
[91bcb492c61dc067945d59357ca6def0d83fcb2c](https://github.com/raylib-rs/raylib-rs/commit/91bcb492c61dc067945d59357ca6def0d83fcb2c)
(v5.5.1 release), which was a fork of
[github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs).

Check out the [examples](./examples) directory to find usage examples. See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the 6.x changes, including breaking signature
changes and the new APIs wrapped from raylib 6.0.

sola-raylib development happens on `main`. This README.md covers what's in
`main`. Be sure to view the tag version of the repository if you want to find
details on a specific version.

The latest released version on crates.io is 6.1.0 (binds raylib 6.0).

Pull from GitHub if you want the latest `main`:

```
raylib = { package = "sola-raylib", git = "https://github.com/brettchalupa/sola-raylib.git" }
```

## Features / Bugs

Though this binding tries to stay close to the simple C API, it makes some
changes to be more idiomatic for Rust.

- Resources are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope (or when
  `std::mem::drop` is called). This is essentially RAII. This means that
  "Unload" functions are not exposed (and not necessary unless you obtain a
  `Weak` resource using make_weak()).
- Most of the Raylib API is exposed through `RaylibHandle`, which is for
  enforcing that Raylib is only initialized once, and for making sure the window
  is closed properly. RaylibHandle has no size and goes away at compile time.
  Because of mutability rules, Raylib-rs is thread safe!
- A `RaylibHandle` and `RaylibThread` are obtained through through the `init()`
  function which will allow you to `build` up some window options before
  initialization (replaces `set_config_flags`). RaylibThread should not be sent
  to any other threads, or used in a any syncronization primitives (Mutex, Arc)
  etc.
- Manually closing the window is unnecessary, because `CloseWindow` is
  automatically called when `RaylibHandle` goes out of scope.
- `Model::set_material`, `Material::set_shader`, and `MaterialMap::set_texture`
  methods were added since one cannot set the fields directly. Also enforces
  correct ownership semantics.
- `Font::from_data`, `Font::set_chars`, and `Font::set_texture` methods were
  added to create a `Font` from loaded `CharInfo` data.
- `SubText` and `FormatText` are omitted, and are instead covered by Rust's
  string slicing and Rust's `format!` macro, respectively.

### Why use Rust with Raylib instead of C?

There are many benefits to coding games with Raylib using Rust instead of C:

- Memory safety guarantees from the Rust compiler in the code you write.
- Best-in-class developer experience with `cargo` and Rust's language server
  protocol (LSP).
- Lots of great Rust packages for game development and systems programming on
  [crates.io](https://crates.io).
- Easier cross-platform compiling.

## Installation

### Supported Platforms

sola-raylib is focused on supporting Windows, Linux, macOS, and Web targets.

The table below shows which core APIs are supported for which platforms:

| API  | Windows            | Linux              | macOS              | Web                |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| core | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| rgui | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | ❔                 |
| rlgl | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :x:                | ❔                 |

## Build Dependencies

Requires glfw, cmake, and curl. Tips on making things work smoothly on all
platforms is appreciated. Follow instructions for building raylib for your
platform [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki)

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sola-raylib = "6"
```

Then in your code, use it as `sola_raylib`:

```rust
use sola_raylib::prelude::*;
```

### Drop-in replacement for `raylib-rs`

If you're migrating an existing `raylib-rs` project and don't want to touch
every `use raylib::...` statement, use Cargo's package rename so the crate is
still imported as `raylib` in your source code:

```toml
[dependencies]
raylib = { package = "sola-raylib", version = "6" }
```

With that line, all your existing `raylib` code keeps working. The ./examples in
this repository use this style.

2. Start coding!

```rust
use sola_raylib::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let (mut rl, thread) = sola_raylib::init()
        .size(640, 480)
        .title("Hello, World")
        .build();

    while !rl.window_should_close() {
        let mut d = rl.begin_drawing(&thread);

        d.clear_background(Color::WHITE);
        d.draw_text("Hello, world!", 12, 12, 20, Color::BLACK);
    }
}
```

## Building for the web (wasm)

sola-raylib targets `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` so games can run in the browser.
The link flags raylib needs (`-sUSE_GLFW=3`, `-sASYNCIFY=1`,
`-sFORCE_FILESYSTEM=1`, `-sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm`,
`-sEXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=...`, `-sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1`) live in your
project's `.cargo/config.toml`: cargo silently drops `cargo:rustc-link-arg` from
rlib build scripts, so a sys crate can't inject them. raylib's own C compiles
cleanly under rustc 1.93+'s default link ABI; no sys-side cflag tweaks are
needed.

There is also [`game_loop::run`], a cross-platform game-loop helper that
registers a per-frame closure with `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg` on the web and
drives a normal while-loop natively. Same source for both targets.

The full recipe (asset bundling, save data, audio, deploy) lives in
[book/src/web.md](book/src/web.md). Reference example:
[`examples/hello_raylib.rs`](examples/hello_raylib.rs); copyable config:
[`examples/.cargo/config.toml`](examples/.cargo/config.toml). `just build-web`
then `just serve-web` opens it at `http://localhost:3535`.

[`game_loop::run`]: https://docs.rs/sola-raylib/latest/sola_raylib/core/game_loop/fn.run.html

## Cross-compiling using `cross`

Cross compiling with sola-raylib can be made easier with cross. See the
[upstream raylib-rs wiki](https://github.com/raylib-rs/raylib-rs/wiki/Cross%E2%80%90compiling-using-cross)
for a writeup that should still largely apply.

## Tech Notes

- Structs holding resources have RAII/move semantics, including: `Image`,
  `Texture2D`, `RenderTexture2D`, `Font`, `Mesh`, `Shader`, `Material`, and
  `Model`.
- `Wave`, `Sound`, `Music`, and `AudioStream` have lifetimes bound to
  `AudioHandle`.
- Functions dealing with string data take in `&str` and/or return an owned
  `String`, for the sake of safety. The exception to this is the gui draw
  functions which take &CStr to avoid per frame allocations. The `rstr!` macro
  helps make this easy.
- In C, `LoadFontData` returns a pointer to a heap-allocated array of `CharInfo`
  structs. In this Rust binding, said array is copied into an owned
  `Vec<CharInfo>`, the original data is freed, and the owned Vec is returned.
- In C, `LoadDroppedFiles` returns a pointer to an array of strings owned by
  raylib. Again, for safety and also ease of use, this binding copies said array
  into a `Vec<String>` which is returned to the caller.
- Linking is automatic, though I've only tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu, and
  MacOS 15. Other platforms may have other considerations.
- OpenGL 3.3, 2.1, and ES 2.0 may be forced via adding `["opengl_33"]`,
  `["opengl_21"]` or `["opengl_es_20]` to the `features` array in your
  Cargo.toml dependency definition.

## Cargo features

Every Cargo feature exposed by sola-raylib is listed here. The safe crate
forwards each name through to `sola-raylib-sys`, so you can enable them on
either crate and the effect is the same.

**Build / linking**

| Feature   | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bindgen` | yes     | Run `bindgen` at build time to produce FFI bindings. Disable to supply a hand-rolled `bindings.rs` (for platforms bindgen can't target). |
| `nobuild` | no      | Skip compiling and linking raylib entirely. For docs.rs and headless setups; you are then responsible for linking raylib yourself.       |

**Platform & rendering backend**

| Feature             | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wayland`           | no      | Build raylib's GLFW with native Wayland support on Linux. Requires the system `glfw-devel` (CMake config files), not just the runtime; see "Building for Wayland on Linux" below. Without this feature, GLFW uses X11/XWayland.                                           |
| `sdl`               | no      | Use the SDL platform backend instead of GLFW. raylib prefers SDL3 and falls back to SDL2; the build script links whichever it resolved. Install with `sudo dnf install SDL2-devel` (Fedora), `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu), `brew install sdl2` (macOS). |
| `opengl_33`         | no      | Force OpenGL 3.3 backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `opengl_21`         | no      | Force OpenGL 2.1 backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `opengl_es_20`      | no      | Force OpenGL ES 2.0 backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `opengl_es_30`      | no      | Force OpenGL ES 3.0 backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Behavior toggles**

| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `custom_frame_control` | no      | Enable raylib's `SUPPORT_CUSTOM_FRAME_CONTROL` so you drive frame timing yourself (call `SwapScreenBuffer`, `PollInputEvents` manually).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `noscreenshot`         | no      | Disable raylib's built-in F12-screenshot keybind. Implemented by pre-defining `SUPPORT_SCREEN_CAPTURE=0` directly on the C compile line, leaving the rest of raylib's `SUPPORT_*` defaults intact. (Earlier 6.0 builds routed this through CMake's `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD` switch and broke rendering on Linux; see [issue #40](https://github.com/brettchalupa/sola-raylib/issues/40), fixed in 6.1.) |

**Interop**

| Feature        | Default | Effect                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `with_serde`   | no      | Derive `serde::Serialize` / `Deserialize` on the public types via `serde` + `serde_json`. |
| `convert_mint` | no      | Implement conversions to/from [`mint`](https://docs.rs/mint) math types.                  |

> **Removed in 6.1:** the `nogif` feature is gone. Raylib 6.0 dropped its
> built-in GIF recorder upstream, so `nogif` had no effect, just the harmful
> side-effect of triggering the same `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD` regression as
> `noscreenshot`. If you previously listed it in your Cargo.toml, just remove
> it.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

On Windows, your compiled binary will show a log window by default. If you want
to hide this, add the following to your `main.rs`:

```rust
#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]
```

## Experimental raylib 6.0 platform flags

sola-raylib 6.0 exposes three feature flags for raylib 6.0's new backends. **All
three are experimental upstream**, shipped with known gaps in raylib 6.0 itself.
We surface them for opt-in use, but what actually renders or links is whatever
raylib's C side supports at HEAD. Expect rough edges.

- `software_render`: compiles raylib with the CPU `rlsw` software rasterizer.
  **Must be combined with the `sdl` feature** on Linux/macOS because rlsw is not
  compatible with raylib's default GLFW desktop backend (confirmed upstream in
  [raylib#5664](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/5664); enabling only
  `software_render` produces a black window). The `sdl` feature needs SDL dev
  headers installed at build time; raylib prefers SDL3 and falls back to SDL2,
  and our `build.rs` auto-detects which is present via `pkg-config`. Install
  with `sudo dnf install SDL2-devel` on Fedora, `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
  on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install sdl2` on macOS. Typical usage:

  ```
  # Linux or macOS, with SDL installed:
  cargo add sola-raylib --features sdl,software_render
  ```

  Or to try it from this repo: `just example-sw hello_raylib`.

  Windows would need the `rcore_desktop_win32` native backend (not yet wired in
  sola-raylib).
- `platform_memory`: compiles the `PLATFORM=Memory` headless framebuffer
  backend. The backend builds and links; the APIs for reading the framebuffer
  back out (from `rlsw.h`, e.g. `swGetColorBuffer`) are **not yet wrapped in the
  safe crate**, so there's no usable headless-capture path today.
- `platform_web_rgfw`: swaps the Emscripten/GLFW web backend for RGFW
  (`PLATFORM=WebRGFW`) when cross-compiling to `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`. Only
  meaningful with an emscripten build loop.

If you're evaluating one of these for production, test on your target platform
first and expect to track upstream raylib for fixes.

## Drop ordering

Resources like `Texture2D`, `RenderTexture2D`, `Font`, `Model`, `Mesh`, and
`Shader` hold GPU handles and free them in their `Drop` impl. `RaylibHandle`'s
`Drop` calls `CloseWindow()`, which tears down the GL context. **GPU resources
must drop before the `RaylibHandle`** — otherwise their unload calls run against
a dead context and segfault.

Rust drops local variables in reverse declaration order, and struct fields in
**declaration order**. So if you hold both resources and `RaylibHandle` in the
same struct, declare `rl` last:

```rust
struct Engine {
    // resources (dropped first, while the GL context is still alive)
    texture: Texture2D,
    rt: RenderTexture2D,
    // handle (dropped last -> CloseWindow runs after resources are unloaded)
    thread: RaylibThread,
    rl: RaylibHandle,
}
```

The same rule applies when `rl` and resources are locals in the same function:
declare `rl` first so it drops last.

Audio resources (`Wave`, `Sound`, `Music`, `AudioStream`) are lifetime-bound to
`RaylibAudio`, so the borrow checker enforces their ordering for you — no
discipline required.

## Building from source

1. Clone repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules`
2. `cargo build`

### If building for Wayland on Linux

1. Install these packages:\
   `libglfw3-dev wayland-devel libxkbcommon-devel wayland-protocols wayland-protocols-devel libecm-dev`
2. Enable wayland by adding `features=["wayland"]` to your dependency definition

**Note that the packages may not be a comprehensive list, please add details for
your distribution or expand on these packages if you believe this to be
incomplete.**

## Extras

- In addition to the base library, there is also a convenient `ease` module
  which contains various interpolation/easing functions ported from raylib's
  `easings.h`, as well as a `Tween` struct to assist in using these functions.
- Equivalent math and vector operations, ported from `raymath.h`, are `impl`ed
  on the various Vector and Matrix types. Operator overloading is used for more
  intuitive design.
