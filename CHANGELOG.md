# sola-raylib Changelog

## 6.1.0 - UNRELEASED

### Removed

- **`nogif` Cargo feature.** raylib 6.0 dropped its built-in GIF recorder
  upstream (the rcore module no longer references `SUPPORT_GIF_RECORDING`), so
  the feature had no functional effect since the 6.0 bump. Drop the feature from
  your `Cargo.toml`; nothing replaces it.
  [Raylib C example for recording.](https://www.raylib.com/examples/core/loader.html?name=core_screen_recording)

### Fixed

- **`noscreenshot` feature now actually works on Linux** ([#40]). The 6.0 build
  routed it through raylib's `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD=ON` CMake switch, which also
  defines `EXTERNAL_CONFIG_FLAGS` and makes raylib's `config.h` skip its entire
  defaults block. Every `SUPPORT_*` macro then went undefined (rtextures,
  partialbusy wait, gestures, etc.), so the window mapped but never rendered on
  X11/XWayland and failed to appear at all on native Wayland. The fix
  pre-defines `SUPPORT_SCREEN_CAPTURE=0` directly on the C compile line via
  `cflag`, so `config.h`'s `#ifndef` guard short-circuits while every other
  default flows through normally. The F12 keybind is gone from the compiled
  `libraylib.a`, rendering and Wayland init are unaffected.
- **`custom_frame_control` feature was a no-op since the 6.0 bump.** The build
  used `builder.define("SUPPORT_CUSTOM_FRAME_CONTROL", "ON")`, which sets a
  CMake variable that only reaches the C compiler when `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD=ON` is
  also set (and that path is the same one that broke `noscreenshot`). Switched
  to the same `cflag("-DSUPPORT_CUSTOM_FRAME_CONTROL=1")` approach so the
  feature actually flips the `#if SUPPORT_CUSTOM_FRAME_CONTROL` guards in
  `rcore.c` (`SwapScreenBuffer`, `PollInputEvents`, frame-time wait become
  user-driven, as documented).

### Documentation

- New canonical "Cargo features" section in the top-level README listing every
  feature, its default state, and platform notes. The `sola-raylib-sys` README's
  table now points here.
- New [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) under `book/` for long-form
  recipes. First chapter [`book/src/web.md`](book/src/web.md) walks through wasm
  builds end to end: toolchain, the canonical `.cargo/config.toml`, the
  `game_loop::run` vs Asyncify tradeoff, asset bundling, save data, audio,
  deploy, pitfalls. Top-level README and the `lib.rs` crate docs link to it.
  Closes [#34].

[#34]: https://github.com/brettchalupa/sola-raylib/issues/34

### Added

- **Cross-platform game-loop helper `sola_raylib::core::game_loop::run`.**
  Native: drives the standard `while !rl.window_should_close()` loop. On
  `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`: registers the per-frame closure with
  `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg` so you don't need `-sASYNCIFY=1` just for the
  loop. Same source for both. `examples/hello_raylib.rs` demonstrates it.
- **Wasm build recipe is now in-tree.** Cargo silently drops
  `cargo:rustc-link-arg` from rlib build scripts, so `raylib-sys` cannot inject
  linker flags into a downstream binary's link step. The flags raylib needs
  (`-sUSE_GLFW=3`, `-sASYNCIFY=1`, `-sFORCE_FILESYSTEM=1`,
  `-sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm`, `-sEXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=...`,
  `-sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1`) live in the consumer's `.cargo/config.toml`. See
  [`book/src/web.md`](book/src/web.md) and the copyable
  [`examples/.cargo/config.toml`](examples/.cargo/config.toml). raylib's own C
  compiles cleanly under rustc 1.93+'s default link ABI; if you have your own
  C/C++ deps via cc-rs, add
  `CFLAGS_wasm32_unknown_emscripten = "-fwasm-exceptions -sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm"`
  to your `[env]` block.
- `RaylibBuilder` now exposes every raylib 6.0 `ConfigFlags` value as a
  dedicated builder method, so callers don't need to drop to `SetConfigFlags`
  for options the builder didn't cover. New methods:
  - `borderless_windowed()` (`FLAG_BORDERLESS_WINDOWED_MODE`) for a
    fullscreen-sized chromeless window. Friendlier than exclusive `fullscreen()`
    on modern desktops (no mode switch, fast Alt+Tab, plays well with
    multi-monitor and notifications).
  - `hidden()`, `minimized()`, `maximized()`, `unfocused()`, `topmost()`,
    `always_run()`, `mouse_passthrough()` covering the rest of the
    `FLAG_WINDOW_*` family.
  - `interlaced()` (`FLAG_INTERLACED_HINT`) for 3D TV setups.
- Doc note on `fullscreen()` recommending `borderless_windowed()` on modern
  platforms.

## 6.0.0 - Apr 24, 2026

Upgrade to **raylib 6.0** and **raygui 5**. sola-raylib's major version tracks
raylib's, so 6.x binds raylib 6.0. See raylib's [6.0 release notes][raylib-6]
for the full upstream story.

### Breaking

- raylib 6.0 — upstream redesigned skeletal animation, fullscreen modes, the
  build-config system, and more. Most safe wrappers are unchanged; the
  exceptions are below.
- `RaylibModel::bind_pose` and `bind_pose_mut` now return `Option<&[Transform]>`
  (was `Option<&Transform>`). The underlying field is an array sized by
  `boneCount`, so the old signature read garbage past the first bone.
- Removed `RaylibMesh::indicies` / `indicies_mut`. The typo'd aliases were
  deprecated in 5.5.3 with a "removed in 6.0" note — use `indices` /
  `indices_mut`.
- `DrawModelPoints` / `DrawModelPointsEx` removed — raylib 6.0 dropped these
  from its public API.
- **Removed the rlImGui / imgui integration.** The `imgui` feature, the
  `raylib::imgui` module, the `RayImGUITrait` and friends, the rlImGui
  submodule, and the `imgui` example are all gone. sola-raylib is focused on
  raylib + raygui; if you want imgui-in-raylib, use a community bridge crate or
  roll a small integration crate against `sola-raylib-sys`.
- **Removed the physac status row from the README.** There was no actual physac
  binding in the safe crate; the row was aspirational. Physac itself is a
  separate raylib-extras library — a real binding would live in its own crate.

### Added

New API wrappers for raylib 6.0 additions:

- Models: `update_model_animation_ex` (animation blending).
- Input: `get_key_name`.
- Hashing: `compute_sha256`, `compute_sha1`, `compute_md5`, `compute_crc32`.
- Shapes (`RaylibDraw`): `draw_line_dashed`, `draw_ellipse_v`,
  `draw_ellipse_lines_v`.
- Text: `measure_text_codepoints`.
- Math: `Vector2::cross_product`, `Matrix::multiply_value`, `Matrix::compose`.
- Pixel helpers in `core::texture`: `get_pixel_color` and `set_pixel_color`
  (take a `PixelFormat` enum and byte slice, validate slice length).

### Fixed

- **`RaylibMesh::tangents` / `tangents_mut` return `&[Vector4]` /
  `&mut
  [Vector4]`** (was `Vector3`). Raylib stores tangents as
  `float[4 *
  vertexCount]` (XYZW where W is the bitangent sign), but the
  previous cast sliced 3 of every 4 floats and produced misaligned reads.
  Covered by a new unit test in `raylib/src/core/models.rs`.
- **CMake `USE_WAYLAND` flag updated to `GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND`.** Upstream renamed
  the knob in 6.0; our `wayland` feature was silently a no-op until this fix.
- Removed two long-silent no-op CMake defines (`SUPPORT_BUSY_WAIT_LOOP=OFF`,
  `SUPPORT_FILEFORMAT_JPG=ON`). raylib 6.0 ignores `SUPPORT_*` overrides unless
  `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD=ON` is also set; experimentally turning that on caused
  unresponsive windows (black screen + "window is not responding") on Linux/X11.
  Keeping raylib's config.h defaults is the safe choice for 6.0.0.
  `custom_frame_control`, `noscreenshot`, and `nogif` features still activate
  `CUSTOMIZE_BUILD=ON` locally when enabled, so those paths keep working.
- Audio: `Wave::export_as_code`. Raw audio-thread processor hooks as
  `unsafe fn`s that take `extern "C" fn(*mut c_void, u32)` pointers:
  `AudioStream::attach_audio_stream_processor` /
  `detach_audio_stream_processor`, and
  `RaylibAudio::attach_audio_mixed_processor` / `detach_audio_mixed_processor`.
  Ergonomic closure wrapping is future work; the raw pointer interface is honest
  about the audio-thread risk.

New examples exercising the new surface: `animation_blending`, `shapes_new`,
`borderless_fullscreen`, `pixel_color` (HSV wheel painted via `set_pixel_color`,
read back under the cursor with `get_pixel_color`). The `input` example now also
displays `get_key_name`.

### Other

- `raylib-sys/README.md` rewritten to reflect the current build-time bindgen
  flow; the old doc described a workflow that no longer exists.
- `DEVELOPING.md` gains a "Bumping raylib" checklist.
- New opt-in feature flags for raylib 6.0's new platform backends. **All three
  are experimental upstream and may not work well yet.** Raylib 6.0 shipped them
  as new backends with known gaps. We expose the flags so you can opt in; what
  actually renders or links is whatever upstream supports today.
  - `software_render`: build raylib with the CPU `rlsw` backend
    (`OPENGL_VERSION=Software`). rlsw is **not compatible with the default GLFW
    desktop backend** per upstream (raylib#5664), so use it via
    `--features "sdl,software_render"` on Linux/macOS (requires SDL2 dev
    headers). `just example-sw <name>` and `just examples-sw` wire that combo
    for you. Windows would need the `rcore_desktop_win32` native backend, which
    sola-raylib does not wire yet.
  - `platform_memory`: build raylib with the headless `PLATFORM=Memory` backend.
    The feature compiles the backend, but reading the framebuffer requires
    `rlsw.h` APIs (e.g. `swGetColorBuffer`) that are **not yet wrapped** in the
    safe crate. Post-release work.
  - `platform_web_rgfw`: use raylib's RGFW-based web backend
    (`PLATFORM=WebRGFW`) when cross-compiling to `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`. No
    local demo path. Requires an emscripten build loop.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `thiserror` from `1.x` to `2.x` in the public dep graph. Our public
  `Error` type still implements `std::error::Error`, so no API change for users.
  Only matters if you pin `thiserror = "1"` elsewhere in your `Cargo.toml`;
  cargo will resolve both versions side by side, or you can bump your own pin.
- Dev-deps (`rand 0.8 → 0.10`) and build-deps (`cmake`, `cc`, `bindgen` patch
  updates) refreshed to current versions. These are not in the downstream user's
  dep graph.
- Patch/minor refresh via `cargo update` across `cfg-if`, `paste`, `seq-macro`,
  `serde`, `serde_json`, `ringbuf`.

## 5.5.3 - Apr 24, 2026

Doc improvements and bug fixes ported from upstream raylib-rs, scoped to
soundness and correctness. Thanks to all the original authors linked below.

### Breaking

- `Image::export_image_to_memory` now returns `Result<Vec<u8>, Error>` instead
  of `Result<&[u8], Error>`. The previous signature leaked on every call
  (raylib's buffer was never freed) and had an unsound lifetime. Adapted from
  raylib-rs [#250][rr-250] / [#247][rr-247].

### Deprecated

- `RaylibMesh::indicies` / `indicies_mut` — use `indices` / `indices_mut`. The
  typo'd names stay through 5.x and are removed in 6.0.

### Fixed

- **Soundness:** `RaylibMesh` accessors return an empty slice when the
  underlying buffer is null instead of invoking UB via
  `slice::from_raw_parts(null, _)` ([raylib-rs#257][rr-257]).
- **Soundness:** `RaylibMesh::indices` length is now `triangleCount * 3` (what
  raylib allocates) rather than `vertexCount` ([raylib-rs#257][rr-257]).
- **Soundness:** `Sound::alias` lifetimes correctly bind the sound's lifetime to
  the receiver ([`4d53bd4`][rr-4d53bd4]).
- **Use-after-free:** `load_model_animations` frees only the outer array via
  `MemFree`, rather than `UnloadModelAnimations` which also tore down the
  animations the `Vec` had just taken ownership of ([`ccc0827`][rr-ccc0827]).
- **Data corruption:** `AudioStream::update` passes element count (not byte
  size) to `ffi::UpdateAudioStream`, matching the C API
  ([raylib-rs#212][rr-212]).
- `Texture2D::update_texture_rec` validates the destination rectangle and sizes
  the expected pixel buffer from rect dimensions ([`cb0c004`][rr-cb0c004]).
- Closure-based draw helpers (`draw`, `draw_mode2D`, etc.) no longer call
  `ffi::End*()` twice — the handle's `Drop` already does
  ([`aadf1a7`][rr-aadf1a7]).
- `gui_text_box` and `gui_text_input_box` grow the buffer and round-trip the
  null terminator, so text input works ([`e2be94b`][rr-e2be94b]).
- `gui_panel` passes a null pointer for empty strings, matching `GuiPanel`'s C
  API ([`95234d1`][rr-95234d1]).

### Other

- Add docs to README on drop ordering.
- CI and `just ok` build with `--all-targets` so examples are exercised
  alongside the library crates.
- Examples look better on High DPI screens.
- `just examples` to quickly run a bunch of different examples.

## 0.10.0 (WIP)

- Basic macOS support. Currently untested.
- Improved ergonomics across the board:
  - Copied over and tweaked many FFI structs so that fields use proper types
    instead of FFI types.
  - Added `vec2`, `vec3`, `quat`, `rgb`, and `rgba` convenience functions for a
    middle ground between `From` conversion and `new` methods.
  - Changed several key and gamepad functions to use `u32`, making it more
    ergonomic with key/gamepad constants.
  - Added optional `prelude` module for conveniently bringing in all the common
    types and definitions.
- Fixed unnecessary `&mut` in `load_image_ex` and `draw_poly_ex`.
- Fixed linking on MSVC toolchains by including `user32`.
- Prevent `RaylibHandle` from being manually constructed. Fixes a safety
  soundness hole.

## 0.9.1

- Fixed docs.rs build by removing use of a uniform module path. This also keeps
  the crate compatible with Rust 1.31+.

## 0.9.0

- Initial crates.io release
